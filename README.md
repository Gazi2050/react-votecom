```javascript
const { separateVotingFunction, combinedVotingFunction } = require('react-votecom');

// Example usage of separateVotingFunction
const initialVotingStats = { upvotes: 0, downvotes: 0 };
const updatedStats = separateVotingFunction(initialVotingStats, 'upvote');
console.log(updatedStats);

// Example usage of combinedVotingFunction
const initialVotingStats = { upvotes: 0, downvotes: 0 };
const voteResult = combinedVotingFunction(initialVotingStats, 'upvote');
console.log(voteResult);
```
